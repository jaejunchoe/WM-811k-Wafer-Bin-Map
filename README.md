# WM-811k Wafer Bin Map

I took this course during the second semester of my junior year. The material was used as a preliminary preparation stage for the project in the [Capstone Design 1](https://github.com/jaejunchoe/2024-1_Capstone-Design) course.

These are the files in which I have directly analyzed the Wafer Bin Map dataset from Kaggle, known as WM-811k.
